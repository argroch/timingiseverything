# Timing Is Everything

We've all been there: you don't need to know just what time it is - you need to know which part of the day it is! That's where this gem comes in!

### Usage:

`require 'timingiseverything'`

`puts TimingIsEverything.part_of_day`


### A Note from the Author...
So, of course, I no one really has a practical use for this gem. But I wanted to try out making my own gem, and had no good ideas for a useful one. And so, Timing is Everything was born! You're welcome.
